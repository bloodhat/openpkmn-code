<h3>Please note that your regstration information is being sent <i>in the clear</i>.  This means that if someone is eavesdropping your connection they can get your user name and password.  <i>Don't use a username and password pair that would cause you strife in the unlikely event that it is discovered!!</i></h3>
  <h4>Eventually this will be SSL encrypted.  An MD5 hash of the password is stored on the server.  The actual opepkmn client/server pair uses AES for encryption.</h4>
